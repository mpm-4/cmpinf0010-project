    "# Project Introduction and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze neighborhood parks data to identify which neighborhood offers the best park experience. Using available data, I focused on quantitative metrics such as the number of parks and the total acreage of park space in each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Metric Description and Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric developed to evaluate the best neighborhood combines two key features from the parks dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Parks:** The count of parks within each neighborhood, serving as an indicator of access and availability to green spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Total Park Acreage:** The sum of park sizes in acres within each neighborhood, reflecting the amount of green space and potential quality of park experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features balance quantity and quality, as having many small parks may differ from fewer but larger parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used includes detailed information about parks, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Park names\n",
    "- Neighborhood subdivision (`divname`) which is the basis for grouping\n",
    "- Acreage of each park\n",
    "- Additional attributes related to park type, maintenance, and facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined metric ranks neighborhoods by both number of parks and total acreage, summing ranks to produce an overall neighborhood ranking that reflects both the quantity and size of parks."
